# Skill Sphere
(University Project)

Skill Sphere is a website designed for univeristy students, recent graduates, and anyone looking to expand their skills in their free time. We offer user made courses featuring video presentations and quizzes to measure your understanding.

As users learn they earn points which can be redeemed for gift cards, as well as badges to show off on their profile.

Unsure where to start? Try out a Skill Path - designed to give you a head start in any field with the best courses picked by our admins. We have paths for business, art, tech and more. If you're still overwhelmed by the possibilities presented by Skill Sphere, take a quiz to see which courses are best for you interests, career and skill level.

Once you've finished a course, you can give it a review and rate it to let others know you found it helpful.
