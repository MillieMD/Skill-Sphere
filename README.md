# Skill Sphere
(University Project)

Skill Sphere is a website designed for univeristy students, recent graduates, and anyone looking to expand their skills in their free time. We offer user made courses featuring video presentations and quizzes to measure your understanding.

As users learn they earn points which can be redeemed for gift cards, as well as badges to show off on their profile.

Unsure where to start? Try out a Skill Path - designed to give you a head start in any field with the best courses picked by our admins. We have paths for business, art, tech and more. If you're still overwhelmed by the possibilities presented by Skill Sphere, take a quiz to see which courses are best for you interests, career and skill level.

Once you've finished a course, you can give it a review and rate it to let others know you found it helpful.

## Features

Skill Sphere is currently in development, once it's up and runnig you can expect:

### Courses 
**[Not Implemented]**  
Courses are user created content, consisting of “modules” which are either a video lesson and description, or a quiz. Once a user has created a course, they may edit the number, order and content of the modules or delete the course entirely.

Courses are tagged to allow users to search for relevant courses easier.

Users enrol onto courses, and as they watch the videos, they earn points. 

Users may review and rate courses out of five stars, to help other users make informed decisions. In addition to this, there will also be a report button in case a course contains hateful or otherwise dangerous content.

### Quizzes 
**[Not Implemented]**  
As part of a course a user may take a quiz to assess their understanding. These quizzes can be 1+ questions long and can consist of either multiple choice or short write in questions.

### Search Filtering 
**[Not Implemented]**  
Users can search by name, or categories, for courses they would like to enrol on. Categories are larger groupings of tags, for example “Technology” may be a larger category containing the tags “Python” and “Electronics”.

Users can filter the search results by rating, number of learners.

### Redeem Gift Cards 
**[Not Implemented]**  
The points that users earn can be redeemed for gift cards for various businesses.

### Progress Tracking 
**[Not Implemented]**  
A users profile keeps track of the courses they are currently enrolled on, their completed courses, courses they have made, and their “badges”.

### Badges 
**[Not Implemented]**  
Badges are achievements users can earn that are displayed on their profile. For example, if a user completes 10 courses, they may earn a badge, another at 100 etc.

### Skill Paths 
**[Not Implemented]**  
Skill paths group different relevant courses together for users who want to improve in a particular field. For example, the “Back-End Development” skill path may contain courses teaching PHP, SQL etc.

### Course Recommendation Quiz 
**[Not Implemented]**  
At any time a user can take a quiz which will ask questions about their current career, their interests, their career goals and will recommend them a course to try out.


We are always open to suggestions, and aim to constantly improve the site as we believe if we're doing our best, so are you.
